          <h3>Call Centre Trend</h3>
          <p>As a Power BI analyst on the PwC virtual internship team through Forage, I collaborated with the manager of PhoneNow call center. 
            My main responsibility was to create a detailed Power BI dashboard that encapsulates essential key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics derived from their data. 
            This dashboard aimed to provide a focused overview of long-term client and agent behavior patterns.
                                                                               
        <p>Insights Overview: <br>

            ✪ The PhoneNow Call Center handled 5000 calls from January to March, achieving an 81% answer rate with 4054 calls answered. <br>
            
            ✪ January experienced the highest call volume during this period. <br>
            
            ✪ Among the answered calls (4054), 3646 were successfully resolved, constituting approximately 90%, while the remaining 10% remained unresolved. <br>
            
            ✪ The average speed of answer for calls was 67.52 seconds. <br>
            
            ✪ The overall customer satisfaction rating for the analyzed period was 3.4, indicating a moderately satisfactory level. <br>
            
            ✪ All agents demonstrated a high percentage of calls answered, with Jim, Dan, and Becky leading in the percentage of resolved calls. Conversely, Jim and Diane had the highest percentage of unresolved calls. <br>
            
            ✪ Technical support and payment-related issues emerged as the areas with the highest number of unresolved calls, suggesting an opportunity for improvement in these areas.</p>
        
            <p>Recommendations: <br>
                ✪ Providing additional training or resources to agents could contribute to an even higher resolution rate. <br>
                ✪ While the average speed of answer at 67.52 seconds is reasonable, efforts can be made to reduce this time further. Streamlining processes or implementing additional support during peak call times may contribute to a quicker response. <br>
                ✪ Since technical support and payment-related issues had the highest number of unresolved calls, special attention should be directed towards improving processes in these specific areas. 
                This could involve additional training for agents or implementing new tools to address these issues promptly. <br>
                ✪ While the overall customer satisfaction rating is moderately satisfactory, efforts should be made to enhance customer satisfaction. 
                This could involve implementing feedback mechanisms, addressing unresolved issues promptly and ensuring a positive customer experience throughout the call process. <br>
                ✪ Find where agents can do better and give them specific help or training to improve. </p>
