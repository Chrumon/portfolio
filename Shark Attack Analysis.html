          <h3>Analysis of Global Shark Attack</h3>
          <p>This dashboard provides a detailed representation of shark attacks spanning the last century, covering aspects like location, activity, victim details (name, gender, age), and shark species. <br>
            The main objective of this analysis is to unveil insights regarding the occurrence of shark attacks globally, pinpoint peak seasons,
            examine prevalent times of day for attacks and ascertain the country with the highest frequency of shark attacks. </p>
            <p>Managing the complexities of the project, my skills in data cleaning and transformation were crucial, particularly due to the challenging state of the data supplied by Quantum Analytics NG.</p>
          
            <p>Key Insights: <br>
                ✪ A total of 6,094 shark attacks were reported, involving 1,464 recorded shark species. <br>
                
                ✪ Among the 157 countries with recorded attacks, the USA, Australia, and South Africa experienced the highest number. <br>
                
                ✪ Victims were predominantly attacked while surfing or swimming, with injuries commonly occurring to the leg and hand. <br>
                
                ✪ Fatalities constituted only 26% of the reported attacks. <br>
                
                ✪ Young adults were the most frequently injured age group. <br>
                
                ✪ Around 21% of the attacks occurred in the afternoon, with approximately 2% happening at night. <br>
                
                ✪ The year 2000 marked the highest recorded number of attacks.</p>
            <p>Recommendations: <br>
                Considering the circumstances, it is recommended to initiate public awareness campaigns, especially in countries, regions, or locations with a high occurrence of attacks. 
                These campaigns have the potential to significantly decrease risks and enhance safety by advocating and enforcing rules for safer practices during water activities.</p>
